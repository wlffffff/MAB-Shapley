Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
My lord, will't please you to fall to?
My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,
Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary.
Help, help, help!
The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed
Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
tell me.
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
                                           [CLARENCE sleeps]
              Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant
