Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
Madam, I will.                                  Exit.
There is ten thousand-
Soldiers, sir.
The English force, so please you.
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
I'll tell him of you.
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
Where is my lady?
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before
To signify th' approaching of his lord,
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love.
A day in April never came so sweet
To show how costly summer was at hand
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
To the laundress, forsooth.
