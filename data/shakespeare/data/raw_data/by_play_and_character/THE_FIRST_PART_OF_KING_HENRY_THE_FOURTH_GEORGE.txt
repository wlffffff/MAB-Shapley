Come and get thee a sword, though made of a lath; they have
been up these two days.
I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the
commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.
Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave
mind than a hard hand.
He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's
leather of.
Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat
cut like a calf.
Argo, their thread of life is spun.
O monstrous coward! What, to come behind folks?
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.
Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us.
What counsel give you? Whither shall we fly?
Yet let us all together to our troops,
And give them leave to fly that will not stay,
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games.
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts,
For yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer; make we hence amain.               Exeunt
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
